  <h1>History of New Zealand </h1>
  <p>A survey of the important events and people in the history of New Zealand from the time of Polynesian settlement.
    Comprising two main islands and a number of small islands, New Zealand is a remote country in the South Pacific
    Ocean,
    lying more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Australia. It was annexed by Great Britain in 1840 and did not
    become
    fully independent until 1947. Despite New Zealand’s isolation, the country has been fully engaged in international
    affairs since the early 20th century.</p>

  <p>New Zealand was first settled by Polynesians from Eastern Polynesia. Linguistic and archaeological evidence
    suggests that humans emigrated from Taiwan via southeast Asia to Melanesia and then radiated eastwards into the
    Pacific in pulses and waves of discovery which gradually colonised islands from Samoa and Tonga all the way to
    Hawaii, the Marquesas, Easter Island, the Society Islands and, finally, New Zealand.</p>
